## Description
Bookify is a web app that allows you to keep track of your reading. 
- You can look for books (there is a limited number of books available at the moment)
- Add books to your list of books to read
- Track your progress as you're reading a book
- Mark books as read

## Scope limitations
This project was focused on practicing React and SQL. As a result:
- The app was built without a real backend, so login and multi-user functionality are not available.
- Responsiveness was not a priority, so the app does not display well on mobile devices.

## Backlog
- Allow for multiple users by creating a backend and adding login functionality.
- Adjust the design and implementation to make the app responsive.
- Cover more scenarios when it comes to updating the current page in a book.
- Allow for users to add the number of pages for a given book for themselves to account for the fact that different editions of a book can have a different number of pages.
- Consider additional functionalities.
